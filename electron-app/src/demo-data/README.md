# Demo Data for VisuaLens

This folder stores sample images to use during development and demo scenarios.

Recommendation:
- Keep images small (200-1200px) for quick prototyping
- Add a JSON manifest `demo-data.json` if you want to precompute captions/embeddings for rapid testing
- Use filenames that include a brief descriptor (e.g., `city_street_001.jpg`)

Optional:
- Provide a `captions.json` with expected captions for the demo assets to speed UI testing.
