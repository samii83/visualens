# Components — Renderer

UI components for VisuaLens (Caption and Search views).

Files:
- `CaptionView.jsx` — Upload/select image and display caption
- `SearchView.jsx` — Search interface with text and image query support

Notes:
- Keep components small and pure where possible
- Use a centralized `api.js` for backend calls
- Add styles using CSS modules or Tailwind as needed
